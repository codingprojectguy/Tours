Web Page Tours using ReactJS

This project is a web application that leverages the power of ReactJS to provide interactive tours, guiding users through various pages or features of a website. The primary objective is to enhance the user experience by offering step-by-step tutorials or introductions to the website's functionalities.
Description

The heart of this project lies in utilizing ReactJS to create a dynamic and interactive environment for users. We make extensive use of useState hook, which enables us to manage the state within functional components. This proves crucial for tracking and updating the tour progress as users navigate through the website.

To ensure a clean and organized codebase, we utilize props, allowing for the efficient transfer of data between components. This facilitates the seamless flow of information necessary for the guided tours, ensuring that the correct steps are presented to the user at each stage.

Moreover, we embrace several other core React features such as component lifecycle methods to handle initialization and cleanup, as well as conditional rendering to display tour components based on user interactions or tour progress.

Incorporating these React features enables us to create a flexible and customizable tour system. Each tour step can be dynamically generated based on the specific content and features of the website. The tours can also be easily styled and themed using React's built-in styling solutions or popular CSS-in-JS libraries.
